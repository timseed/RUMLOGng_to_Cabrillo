# RHUMLogng produce Cabrillo from normal Log

I needed to extract data from a Logbook using RHUMLOGNG and generate a Cabrillo file for submission to the 2023 CQWW CW contest system.

This is done using Python (3+). You only need 2 Modules 

  - BeautifulSoup 
  - hamcabrillo (Written by me) 

There is a Jupyter-Lab notebook for this project.
